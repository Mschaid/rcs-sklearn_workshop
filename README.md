# Northwestern Research Computing Services - Machine Learning with Scikit-learn Workshop

## General Information
This workshop will cover the basics of Scikit-learn, the most popular Python package for predictive modeling and machine learning. Over three days, we will experiment with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, including linear/logistic regression, decision tree and clustering.

Prerequisites: basic Python knowledge at the level of the Python Fundamentals bootcamp; basic statistical knowledge is also recommended.

## Preworkshop Setup
Please have Anaconda installed as we will use Jupyter Notebook/Lab. 

It is also a good practice to create a new environment to avoid any issue with dependencies. Make sure to launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab from this environment. To create a new environment named sklearn_workshop:

```console
conda create -n sklearn_workshop python=3.7 pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn=0.24
```

It's fine to ignore this if you already have the packages above and you don't have any issue importing them in a Jupyter Notebook. There may be issues if your Python version is 3.10, which I think is the newest at this time.
